## Steps that Baxter uses to flip the pancake:
# 1. Move to initial position planar to the pancake
# 2. Follow linear trajectory to slide under the pancake
# 3. Lift pancake vertically
# 4. Rotate wrist to flip pancake
# 5. Retreat to initial position
# 6. slide under pancake again
# 7. Lift pancake vertically again
# 8. Move pancake to plate position
# 9. Flip panckake onto plate
